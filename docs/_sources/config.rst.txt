Paths
-----

The module defines the following paths for storing results and figures:

- ``results_path``: Directory where simulation results are saved
- ``figures_path``: Directory where generated figures are saved
- ``tables_path``: Directory where generated tables are saved

These paths are used by the functions in the ``functions`` module to save outputs from simulations.
